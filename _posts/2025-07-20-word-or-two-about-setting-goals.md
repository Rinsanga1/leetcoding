# For improving oneself in a field

I believe that setting small goals is the key.

in every battle, a winner emerges.
what makes a winner a winner? the one who accomplishes his goal is the winner.

setting goals also helps in gaining better focus.
focus on winning and keep moving forward.

Life is, in the end the journey of battling oneself.

tip:
if your current goal is too hard, chunk it down smaller and smaller and smaller.
