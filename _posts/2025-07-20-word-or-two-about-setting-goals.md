# For improving oneself in a field

I believe that setting small goals is the key.

in every battle, a winner emerges. <br>
and the one who accomplishes his goal is the winner

setting goals also helps in gaining better focus. <br>
focus on winning and keep moving forward.

tip:
if your current goal is too hard, chunk it down smaller and smaller and smaller.
